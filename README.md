I'm a senior level software developer specializing in web applications and browser-based internal tooling. I am passionate about good User Experience through storytelling and common sense.

I do most of my code in TypeScript, but jump into PHP or Python pretty much at a whim. I've concentrated on Angular for several years, but again, I'm always happy to experience React, Vue, and Svelte when the opportunity arises.

Things I have in progress:
* a book on using NX to create Angular micro-frontends with a Nest.js backend, hosted on Firebase
* an Arduino-based backlighting project for a performance space with ~1500 RGB lights
* an automated billing application for private music schools
* learning Japanese
* learning violin

I'm a recording engineer, multi-instrumentalist, Aloha shirt collector, and board game player.
